## Order & Delivery Flow

```
pending → confirmed → preparing → ready → out_for_delivery → delivered
                                     ↑              ↑
                              admin assigns    rider taps
                              a delivery boy   "Start Delivery",
                              (Dashboard)      then "Finish Order"
                                               (Rider App)
```

- **Admin (Dashboard)** moves orders through `pending → confirmed → preparing → ready`, manages the
  delivery boy roster (add / activate-deactivate / remove) on the **Delivery Boys** page, and assigns
  a `ready` order to one of them.
- **Delivery Boy (Rider App)** only sees orders assigned to them. They tap **Start Delivery** (pickup)
  and, once the customer has the order, **Finish Order** to mark it `delivered`. They cannot see the
  menu, reports, or other restaurant settings — login is restricted to their own assigned orders.

## Map Pinning (free — OpenStreetMap, no API key)

All three frontends use **Leaflet + OpenStreetMap** for maps and the free **Nominatim** service for
address search/lookup. No Google Maps API key, no billing account, no usage quota to manage.

- **Customer Website (Checkout)** — a "Pin exact location on map" button opens a map the customer can
  tap, drag, search an address on, or use "locate me" (GPS) to drop a precise pin. The coordinates are
  saved on the order alongside the typed address.
- **Dashboard (Admin)** — if an order has a pinned location, a "View pinned location on map" link
  appears under the customer's address, opening a read-only map with an "Open in Maps" button for
  turn-by-turn directions.
- **Rider App (Delivery Boy)** — each assigned order has a collapsible "Show map · follow address"
  panel showing the destination pin and the rider's own live GPS position (refreshed while the map is
  open) with a line connecting them. The **Navigate** button deep-links to Google Maps directions using
  the precise coordinates when available (falling back to the typed address for older orders).

> Orders placed before this feature, or where the customer skips the map, simply have no
> `customer.location` — everything still works using the typed address as before.

## Quick Start (Local Development)

### 1. Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
npm install

# Copy and fill in environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your MongoDB Atlas URI, Cloudinary credentials, JWT secret

# Seed the database (creates the restaurant account ONCE — see note below)
npm run seed
# → Copy the Restaurant ID printed at the end

npm run dev
# → API running at http://localhost:5000
```

> **About `npm run seed`:** it only creates your restaurant login the *first* time it runs.
> On every later run (e.g. after restarting the server) it detects the existing restaurant
> and does nothing — it never deletes orders, menu items, offers, or delivery boys. Your order
> history and everything else persists across restarts as long as `MONGODB_URI` points to the
> same database. It also does **not** insert any demo menu items or offers — your menu starts
> empty; add real items from **Dashboard → Menu** and any coupons from **Dashboard → Settings**.

### 2. Customer Website Setup

```bash
cd customer-website
npm install

cp .env.example .env
# Set VITE_RESTAURANT_ID to the ID from seed output

npm run dev
# → http://localhost:5173
```

### 3. Dashboard Setup

```bash
cd dashboard
npm install

cp .env.example .env
# Set VITE_RESTAURANT_ID to the ID from seed output

npm run dev
# → http://localhost:5174
```

From the Dashboard, go to **Delivery Boys** in the sidebar to add your first rider (name, phone,
email, password). That email/password is what they'll use to log into the Rider App below.

### 4. Rider App Setup

```bash
cd rider
npm install

cp .env.example .env
# VITE_API_URL / VITE_SOCKET_URL default to localhost:5000 — no restaurant ID needed,
# the rider's login token already scopes them to their restaurant.

npm run dev
# → http://localhost:5175
```

Open this on a phone (or shrink your browser window) — it's built mobile-first with a bottom
tab bar for **Active orders / History / Profile**.

## Production Deployment

### Backend → Render.com

1. Push backend folder to a GitHub repo
2. Create a new **Web Service** on Render
3. Set **Build Command**: `npm install`
4. Set **Start Command**: `node src/app.js`
5. Add all environment variables in Render dashboard
6. Deploy — Render gives you a URL like `https://dfc-api.onrender.com`

### Customer Website → Cloudflare Pages

1. Push customer-website to GitHub
2. Create a new project on Cloudflare Pages
3. Set **Build Command**: `npm run build`
4. Set **Build Output**: `dist`
5. Set environment variables (VITE_API_URL = your Render URL)
6. Deploy

### Dashboard → Cloudflare Pages

Same steps as customer website, using the dashboard folder.

## Future Multi-Restaurant Support

The database schema is already multi-tenant ready:
- Every document has a `restaurantId` field
- All queries are scoped by `restaurantId`
- Adding a new restaurant = create a new `Restaurant` document + seed settings
- To enable multi-restaurant SaaS: add a restaurant selector in auth, route all queries by JWT restaurant ID

## Notification System

When a new order arrives on the dashboard:
1. **Sound** — Web Audio API alert plays every 4 seconds
2. **Tab title** — Flashes between "🔔 NEW ORDER!" and "DFC Dashboard"
3. **Browser notification** — Popup appears (if permission granted)
4. **Badge** — Red pulsing count on the Orders nav item
5. **Card highlight** — Order card glows with orange ring

The alert loop stops **only** when staff clicks **Confirm Order** or **Cancel Order**.
This ensures no order is missed even when the dashboard is in a background tab.
